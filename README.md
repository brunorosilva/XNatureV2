# XNatureV2 Test

This is a test made using the XNatureV2 Dataset by othmane on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/marfoq96othmane/xnaturev2/data)

Context Deep learning have show to have good results on computer vision tasks: Image classification, Object detection, Image retrieval... However few efforts were invested in the field of X-ray image classification, and all the efforts in that field were made in the field of medical x-ray imaging. Thus we propose a dataset of X-ray scans of non medical images.  <br><br>
Content XNatureV2 is a datset of 2985 X-ray scans of natural objects (Gun, Knife, Razor, Shuriken, Key, Salmon, Fruits and Wood)<br><br>  Acknowledgement We have used images from [1] to build this dataset. All the images in the dataset are on air X-ray scans (i.e. No background)<br><br>  References [1] Mery, D.; Riffo, V.; Zscherpel, U.; Mondrag√≥n, G.; Lillo, I.; Zuccar, I.; Lobel, H.; Carrasco, M.
